## Development

Warning! This software developed by a non-programmer person with AI assistants. So, because of that the codebase is probably like hell... However, If you still want to work on it; 
Run this single commands to start development after cloning the repo;

```bash
npm install
npm run go
```


This will:

- Install dependencies (if needed)
- Start Vite dev server
- Launch Electron app automatically

Enjoy exploring Flare Studio, the editor is evolving, feedbacks are always welcome. **Go make games!**
